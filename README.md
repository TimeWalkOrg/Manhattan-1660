## TimeWalk VR/AR/desktop recreation of Manhattan from 1609-present

Contact info@timewalk.org for more information or to contribute to this project.

Building an historically-accurate 3D model of Manhattan in Unity.  This project is the genesis of an open-source effort to recreate cities across time.  The result should be viewable on the Oculus Quest 2, iPhone and iPad (AR), PC desktop, and Macintosh desktop.  v1.0 will include only 1660 New Amsterdam buildings and terrain.  New building and terrain models for 1776, 1609, 1882, etc. will be added later.

A few early screenshots appear below.  The final product will allow street-level views of the city.
